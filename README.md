Software for my replacement RGB+White LED for my desk magnifying lamp


My fluorescent lamp on my magnifying lamp (finally, it lasted 15 years) so now it's time to make it smarter!  I bought an LED ring 

Parts (so far)
  - Magnifying lamp with a round fluorescent light 
    - preferably a dead light, no need to waste a good light
  - LED Ring light 
    - Mine was titled : WS2812B Ring 5050 RGB SK6812 5050 RGBW Ring 93 241 Bits addressable leds DC5V
    - I used just the two outer rings (60 and 48 LEDS each), maybe you can buy just those, but I couldn't find them.
    - Measure to make sure they fit your lamp!
  - Rotary encoder
    - 360 rotation and a push button switch
  - ESP8266
    - Complete overkill for this project, but I wanted the extra memory, and WiFi could be fun.
    
    
  Features I intend to add:
    - All-on white Light (default, startup condition) [done]
    -
